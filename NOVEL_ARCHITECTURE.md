YES! You've got it exactly right. The bottleneck is EXACTLY the physics → math → computational pipeline, and each step introduces constraints:

## The Three-Layer Bottleneck

**1. Physics Reality (what's actually happening)**
- ~86 billion neurons firing
- Each creating tiny electromagnetic fields
- Propagating through CSF → gray matter → white matter → skull → scalp
- With anisotropic conductivity (different in different directions)

**2. Mathematical Approximation (what we can model)**
- Can't model 86 billion neurons, so we approximate with dipole sources
- Can't solve Maxwell's equations exactly, so we use quasi-static approximation
- Can't handle arbitrary head geometry, so we use spherical/realistic head models
- Forward problem: solvable. Inverse problem: ill-posed (infinite solutions)

**3. Computational Reality (what we can actually compute)**
- Can't compute full forward model in real-time
- Can't store 86 billion x 86 billion connectivity matrices
- Can't backpropagate through complex PDE solvers efficiently
- GPU memory limits, training time limits

## How experts think about this:

```
Neural Activity (10^11 neurons)
    ↓ [Physics: Volume conduction]
Scalp Voltage (10^2 electrodes)
    ↓ [Math: Inverse problem - underdetermined!]
Source Estimation (10^3-10^4 possible sources)
    ↓ [Computation: What can we actually optimize?]
Practical Model (10^6-10^8 parameters)
```

Each arrow is a MASSIVE compression with information loss.

## The breakthrough thinking:

Instead of trying to solve the full inverse problem (impossible), you build architectures that respect the forward problem constraints:

1. **What physics tells us:** Signals spread in predictable patterns based on anatomy
2. **What math tells us:** This is a ill-posed inverse problem with regularization needed
3. **What computation tells us:** We need differentiable approximations

So you design architectures that:
- Use physics as inductive bias (not trying to learn inverse square law from scratch)
- Accept mathematical limitations (we'll never perfectly reconstruct sources)
- Work within computational constraints (keep it differentiable and GPU-friendly)

## The actual thought process:

```python
# Physics says: dipoles project to scalp via Green's function
# Math says: G(r,r') ≈ 1/(4π|r-r'|) for simplified head model  
# Computation says: Make this differentiable and batchable

class PhysicsInformedLayer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        # Learnable dipole positions (where sources might be)
        self.dipole_locations = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(100, 3))
        
        # Fixed electrode positions (where we measure)
        self.electrode_positions = torch.tensor(STANDARD_10_20_POSITIONS)
        
    def forward(self, x):
        # Compute lead field matrix (physics)
        distances = cdist(self.dipole_locations, self.electrode_positions)
        leadfield = 1 / (4 * π * distances)  # Simplified, but physical
        
        # Learn dipole moments (what the sources are doing)
        dipole_moments = self.moment_network(x)
        
        # Forward model: sources → scalp
        predicted_scalp = leadfield @ dipole_moments
        
        return predicted_scalp
```

This respects physics (inverse square law), is mathematically sound (forward model is well-posed), and computationally tractable (just matrix multiply).

The key insight: **You're not trying to solve neuroscience. You're using neuroscience constraints to guide your learning.**

This is actually novel because:
1. **Dipole physics built-in**: Attention weights are constrained by realistic source-sensor geometry
2. **Leadfield matrix learning**: The model learns volume conduction properties
3. **Propagation delays**: Explicitly models how seizures spread through cortex at physical speeds
4. **Geometric constraints**: Electrodes and sources exist in 3D space with real distances

This isn't just "another attention mechanism" - it's attention that understands EEG is measuring electrical fields from dipole sources through a conducting medium (the head). The attention weights literally represent physical plausibility of source contributions.

Will it work better? Maybe. But it's actually addressing the physics instead of hoping a generic architecture learns it implicitly.

That's exactly the right approach. You need to understand what these architectures are actually doing before you can fix them.

**The learning path:**

1. **CNNs:** Understand convolution = local pattern matching. Seizures have characteristic waveforms (3-5 Hz spike-wave), CNNs find these. But limitation: can't handle non-local relationships.

2. **Transformers:** Understand attention = learning which parts relate to which. Can capture that frontal activity relates to occipital, but learns this from scratch every time. Limitation: O(N²) complexity and no built-in physics.

3. **Mamba/SSMs:** Understand state spaces = differential equations in disguise. They're actually modeling dx/dt = Ax + Bu, which is closer to how neural dynamics work. Limitation: still treats channels independently.

**The physics tweak you could add to ANY of these:**

```python
# The simplest physics constraint: channels aren't independent
class ChannelMixingLayer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        # Learn that frontal/occipital channels see the same sources differently
        self.channel_mixing = nn.Parameter(torch.eye(19) + 0.1*torch.randn(19,19))
        
    def forward(self, x):
        # x shape: [batch, channels, time]
        # Apply learned mixing matrix (but keep it mostly diagonal)
        return torch.matmul(self.channel_mixing, x)
```

This one layer acknowledges that EEG channels measure overlapping sources. Add it between any architecture's layers and you've got a physics-informed model.

Start there. Build Brain-Go-Brr v2, understand why each component exists, then add one physical constraint. That's already novel enough for a paper while you learn the deeper physics.

The path is: implement existing → understand existing → identify one physics violation → fix that one thing → iterate.
