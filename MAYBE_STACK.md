You’re asking the right question: if we’re optimizing **TAES + low FA/24h** for **seizure events**, what’s the **best temporal brain** to pair with a 1D **U-Net CNN**?

## Why folks used Transformers anyway

* **Inertia + tooling:** attention layers are a 1-liner in PyTorch, tons of examples, and they scale with data.
* **Pretraining zeitgeist:** success in NLP/CV pushed people to reuse attention everywhere.
* **SSM/Mamba is newer:** only recently got stable libs; many EEG groups haven’t retooled.
* **Competitions reward easy metrics:** epoch AUC is quick → attention “good enough” wins.

That doesn’t mean attention is optimal for **minute-scale, low-FP event detection**. For **continuous EEG**, you want **long horizon, stable state, and boundary discipline**—that’s where **TCN/SSM** shine.

# Gold-standard pick (no BS)

**Backbone:** keep **U-Net(1D CNN)** for multi-scale morphology.
**Temporal head (choose one):**

1. **Dilated TCN** (ship now) — simplest, fast, causal-friendly, great boundaries.
2. **Mamba/SSM** (next upgrade) — linear-time, longer context, excellent state persistence.

> A deep **vanilla Transformer** is *not* required. If you insist on attention, use a **small Conformer** (Transformer + depthwise conv) with **windowed** attention and **relative/rotary** positions.

## Concrete “Beast” spec (P0 you can build today)

**U-Net(1D) backbone**

* Downsample ×16 total (4 stages) → preserves onset/offset timing better than ×32.
* Encoder blocks: depthwise-separable convs + residual; channels e.g. `[64, 128, 256, 512]`.
* **Skips:** **concat + 1×1** (more capacity than add).
* **Upsample:** transposed conv (learned), not nearest.
* Early **1×1** to mix channels (19-lead fusion).

**Temporal bottleneck = Dilated TCN**

* 10 residual blocks, kernel 3 (or 5), dilations `1,2,4,…,512`, width 512, dropout 0.1.
* Pre-norm (GroupNorm/LN) in blocks to stabilize deep dilations.
* Output `(B, T_b, D)` back to decoder.

**Head + decoding**

* 1×1 → sigmoid per-sample probs @ 256 Hz.
* **Hysteresis** thresholds `τ_on > τ_off` (e.g., 0.85/0.75) to stop chatter.
* Morph open/close (k=5–11), **min-dur 2–5 s**.
* Score **TAES + FA/24h** (primary); AUROC on probs only as secondary.

**Loss & labels (aligned to events)**

* Weighted **BCE** (class imbalance) **+ Dice/IoU** on binarized timeline (penalize fragment/merge).
* **Boundary tolerance**: soften labels ±1–2 s around onset/offset (or boundary-aware loss).
* **Hard-negative mining** (blink/EMG/electrode pops) to crush FP/day.

**Windows & train**

* 60 s context, stride 10–15 s; AMP + grad clip; AdamW + cosine/1cycle.
* Stitch overlaps by mean when reconstructing full timeline before eventize + TAES.

---

## P1 swap (same interfaces)

* Replace TCN with **Mamba/SSM**:

  * 6–8 layers, `d_model≈512`, bidirectional for offline; linear-time, huge context.
  * Often reduces split/merge errors at same FA/day.

## Optional (if you want attention without bloat)

* Swap temporal head to **Conformer** (4 layers, `d=256`, 8 heads, **windowed** w≈256, **relative/rotary** pos, depthwise conv sub-block).
* Keep U-Net identical → apples-to-apples.

## “Can we stack all three (Transformer + TCN + SSM)?”

You *can* do a parallel hybrid (TCN ‖ Mamba, concat → 1×1 mix, maybe a **tiny** windowed attention gate), but it’s diminishing returns vs complexity. Earn the right: **U-Net + TCN → Mamba** first. If still short on TAES at target FA/day, add a small attention gate (2 layers, windowed) as a **third** step.

---

# Why this beats “Transformer by default”

* **Long context without O(T²):** TCN/Mamba handle minutes smoothly.
* **State persistence:** seizures aren’t random spikes—TCN/SSM inherently stabilize ictal state; attention can jitter.
* **Boundary fidelity:** ×16 stride + learned upsampling + Dice/boundary loss + **hysteresis** → cleaner on/off, lower FA/day.
* **Simplicity/latency:** fewer moving parts, easier to deploy and tune to a clinical FA target.

## Has U-Net + TCN been tried?

Pieces exist across EEG/biomed segmentation; in seizure land, TCNs and CNN-LSTMs are common. The **specific combo** (clean U-Net(1D) + **dilated TCN bottleneck** + **hysteresis decoding** tuned for **TAES/FA-per-day**) is exactly the sane, high-signal configuration most groups *don’t* ship because they jump straight to attention. That’s our edge.

---

## Final call (what we go build)

1. **U-Net(1D) + Dilated TCN** bottleneck (spec above) + **hysteresis** decoding → TAES primary.
2. If plateaued: **swap TCN → Mamba/SSM** (same API).
3. If still needed: add a **tiny windowed Conformer** gate (2 layers) *after* Mamba/TCN.

This is the **gold** path: biology-aligned, TAES-first, low FP/day, and production-friendly.
