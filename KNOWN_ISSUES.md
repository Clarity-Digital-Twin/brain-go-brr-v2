## P0 ISSUES - CRITICAL RUNTIME FAILURES

### EXISTING P0 ISSUES (Already Documented)

- ✅ **FIXED** - Issue: Pipeline CLI requires labels but datasets created without labels
  - Severity: P0 (crash at runtime)
  - Location: src/experiment/pipeline.py: train() and train_epoch(); src/experiment/data.py: EEGWindowDataset
  - Symptoms: `train_epoch` assumes `(windows, labels)` but `EEGWindowDataset` returns only `windows` when `label_files=None` (as used in pipeline.main). Also, `create_balanced_sampler` builds `all_labels` via `train_dataset[i][1]`, which fails when labels are absent.
  - Repro:
    - `python -m src.experiment.pipeline --config configs/production.yaml` (with no label files provisioned)
  - Impact: Training CLI unusable on unlabeled data; sampler creation crashes; first-batch label extraction crashes.
  - Workaround: Provide label files and adapt dataset instantiation; or disable balanced sampling and avoid sampler path (not recommended for production).
  - Owner: Pipeline/Data
  - Notes: Decide contract for `EEGWindowDataset`: always return `(window, label)` and synthesize zeros when labels absent, or adjust pipeline to support unlabeled runs.

- ✅ **FIXED** - Issue: Evaluation entry point in pyproject points to non-existent function
  - Severity: P0 (packaging/CLI break)
  - Location: pyproject.toml: [project.scripts] `evaluate = "src.experiment.evaluate:main"`; but `src/experiment/evaluate.py` has no `main`.
  - Symptoms: Installed script `evaluate` fails to run/import.
  - Repro: `uv run evaluate` (after install)
  - Impact: Broken CLI for evaluation when installed as a package.
  - Workaround: Use `python -m src.cli evaluate ...` instead.
  - Owner: Packaging/CLI
  - Notes: Either add `main()` in evaluate.py or point script to `src.cli:main` with a subcommand.

### NEW P0 ISSUES (Discovered in Deep Audit)

- ✅ **FIXED** - Issue: Dataset returns inconsistent types causing train_epoch to crash
  - Severity: P0 (type mismatch crash)
  - Location: src/experiment/data.py:349-357, pipeline.py:184
  - Symptoms: EEGWindowDataset.__getitem__ returns either `window` alone OR `(window, label)` tuple depending on self._labels state. train_epoch expects ALWAYS `(windows, labels)` tuple.
  - Repro: Run training with dataset that has no labels
  - Impact: TypeError crash: "cannot unpack non-sequence" in train_epoch line 184
  - Fix Plan: ALWAYS return tuple `(window, label)`. When no labels, return zero tensor of correct shape.
  - Code Fix:
    ```python
    # In EEGWindowDataset.__getitem__
    if self._labels:
        label = torch.from_numpy(self._labels[idx])
    else:
        # Return zeros of correct shape when no labels
        label = torch.zeros(self._windows[idx].shape[-1], dtype=torch.float32)
    return window, label
    ```

- ✅ **FIXED** - Issue: Config schema mismatch - production.yaml incompatible with schemas
  - Severity: P0 (config validation failure)
  - Location: configs/production.yaml vs src/experiment/schemas.py
  - Symptoms: Multiple field mismatches:
    1. `batch_size` in yaml under `data:` but not in DataConfig schema
    2. `min_duration` in yaml but schema expects `duration.min_duration_s`
    3. Missing required nested configs (hysteresis, morphology, duration, events)
  - Repro: `Config.from_yaml(Path("configs/production.yaml"))`
  - Impact: Pydantic validation error on config load
  - Fix Plan: Either update yaml to match schema OR update schema to be backward compatible
  - Code Fix: Add missing fields to schemas and update yaml structure

- ✅ **FIXED** - Issue: Train function missing output_dir in config
  - Severity: P0 (AttributeError crash)
  - Location: src/experiment/pipeline.py:476
  - Symptoms: `output_dir = Path(config.experiment.output_dir)` but ExperimentConfig has no `output_dir` field
  - Repro: Run train() with any config
  - Impact: AttributeError: 'ExperimentConfig' object has no attribute 'output_dir'
  - Fix Plan: Add output_dir to ExperimentConfig schema
  - Code Fix:
    ```python
    class ExperimentConfig(BaseModel):
        output_dir: Path = Field(default=Path("outputs"), description="Output directory")
    ```

- ✅ **FIXED** - Issue: Missing PostprocessingConfig fields cause AttributeError
  - Severity: P0 (runtime crash)
  - Location: src/experiment/evaluate.py:170-174
  - Symptoms: Code tries to access `post_cfg.events.tau_merge` and `post_cfg.events.confidence_method` but PostprocessingConfig may not have `events` attribute
  - Repro: Call batch_probs_to_events with minimal PostprocessingConfig
  - Impact: AttributeError when accessing nested config fields
  - Fix Plan: Add proper hasattr checks OR ensure PostprocessingConfig always has events field
  - Code Fix: Already partially fixed with hasattr checks, but schema should enforce structure

- ✅ **FIXED** - Issue: Window stitching not implemented but required for correct FA/24h
  - Severity: P0 (metric correctness)
  - Location: src/experiment/evaluate.py:253, postprocess.py (missing stitch_windows)
  - Symptoms: `total_hours = labels.numel() / (fs * 3600)` counts overlapped time multiple times
  - Impact: FA/24h rates are 6x inflated (60s windows with 10s stride = 6x overlap)
  - Fix Plan: Implement stitch_windows in postprocess.py and use actual recording duration
  - Code Fix:
    ```python
    # Need to track actual recording duration, not sample count
    # Implement window stitching before FA calculation
    ```

- ✅ **FIXED** - Issue: Missing TrainingConfig.batch_size field
  - Severity: P0 (AttributeError)
  - Location: src/experiment/pipeline.py:639, schemas.py TrainingConfig
  - Symptoms: main() tries to use `config.training.batch_size` but TrainingConfig has no such field
  - Repro: Run pipeline.main()
  - Impact: AttributeError: 'TrainingConfig' object has no attribute 'batch_size'
  - Fix Plan: Add batch_size to TrainingConfig OR use config.data.batch_size
  - Code Fix: Change to use `config.data.batch_size` since DataConfig should own this

- ✅ **FIXED** - Issue: FA/24h computed on overlapped windows without stitching
  - Severity: P0 (metric correctness)
  - Location: src/experiment/evaluate.py: sensitivity_at_fa_rates(), find_threshold_for_fa_eventized(); uses `labels.numel()` for time and per-window events without stitching.
  - Symptoms: `total_hours = labels.numel() / (fs * 3600)` double-counts time when windows overlap; predicted events are computed per-window and not stitched across boundaries.
  - Impact: FA/24h and threshold search are inaccurate; downstream sensitivity@FA and TAES become unreliable.
  - Workaround: For now, evaluate on non-overlapping segments only; or pre-stitch probabilities to full timelines before calling evaluation.
  - Owner: Evaluation/Post-processing
  - Notes: Blocked on Phase 4 stitching APIs. Replace with `stitch_windows()` and compute actual per-record duration.

- ✅ **FIXED** - Issue: Threshold search is a no-op (unused `threshold`)
  - Severity: P0 (metric correctness)
  - Location: src/experiment/evaluate.py:164, 256–263
  - Symptoms: `find_threshold_for_fa_eventized` binary-searches a `threshold`, but `batch_probs_to_events` ignores it (pipeline uses hysteresis only). FA/24h won’t change across iterations.
  - Impact: Sensitivity@FA and FA tuning are unreliable; search converges arbitrarily.
  - Fix Plan (Decision below): Search over hysteresis τ_on (and derive τ_off), not a separate global threshold. Remove/ignore `threshold` arg.
  - Owner: Evaluation/Post-processing
  - Notes: Update tests to verify FA rate monotonicity under τ_on search.

- ✅ **FIXED** - Issue: Postprocessing config drift can cause AttributeError
  - Severity: P0 (runtime crash)
  - Location: src/experiment/evaluate.py:170–177, src/experiment/schemas.py (older configs)
  - Symptoms: Access to `post_cfg.events.*` may fail if older, flat PostprocessingConfig is used.
  - Impact: Runtime AttributeError in evaluation on older configs.
  - Fix Plan: Enforce typed nested PostprocessingConfig (hysteresis/morphology/duration/events/stitching) and validate at load. Provide a lightweight migration shim for legacy keys.
  - Owner: Schemas/Packaging

- ✅ **FIXED** - Issue: Packaging entrypoint mismatch (evaluate)
  - Severity: P0 (packaging/CLI break)
  - Location: pyproject.toml: [project.scripts] evaluate = "src.experiment.evaluate:main"
  - Symptoms: No `main()` in evaluate.py → installed CLI fails.
  - Impact: Users cannot run `evaluate` after install.
  - Fix Plan: Either add minimal `main()` in evaluate.py delegating to src.cli, or repoint script to `src.cli:main` subcommand.
  - Owner: Packaging/CLI

## P1 ISSUES - LOGIC ERRORS AND AMBIGUITIES

### EXISTING P1 ISSUES

- ✅ **FIXED** - Issue: Eventization semantics unclear; unused variable suggests mismatch
  - Severity: P1 (logic ambiguity, not a crash)
  - Location: src/experiment/evaluate.py: batch_probs_to_events()
  - Symptoms: Variable `binary = (prob_np > threshold)` computed but unused; hysteresis gates directly on raw probs (τ_on/τ_off). It mixes a global threshold and hysteresis, but only hysteresis affects the final mask.
  - Impact: Threshold parameter may not influence outputs as expected; harder to reason about FA/threshold search.
  - Workaround: Treat `threshold` as unused and rely on hysteresis only; or remove hysteresis temporarily.
  - Owner: Evaluation/Post-processing
  - Notes: To be resolved when Phase 4 APIs land (apply_hysteresis vs global thresholding).

### NEW P1 ISSUE (Discovered in Audit)

- ✅ **FIXED** - Issue: Threshold parameter completely ignored in batch_probs_to_events
  - Severity: P1 (silent logic error)
  - Location: src/experiment/evaluate.py:150-182
  - Symptoms: threshold parameter passed but never used; postprocess_predictions doesn't accept threshold
  - Impact: FA threshold search may not work as intended; all thresholds produce same results
  - Fix Plan: Either remove threshold param OR implement proper global thresholding before hysteresis
  - Code Fix: Pass threshold to postprocess_predictions or apply before calling it

- 📚 **ARCHIVED** - Issue: Memory-heavy window materialization in dataset
  - NOTE: This is a design decision for Phase 1. Future streaming implementation planned.
  - Severity: P1 (scaling blocker)
  - Location: src/experiment/data.py: EEGWindowDataset
  - Symptoms: All windows are precomputed and kept in memory.
  - Impact: OOM for large corpora; not viable for full TUH.
  - Workaround: Keep for unit tests and small runs; switch to streaming/dynamic windowing for large runs.
  - Owner: Data/Infra
  - Notes: Planned improvement; not urgent for unit/integration tests.

- ✅ **FIXED** - Issue: GPU morphology path unimplemented
  - Severity: P1 (feature gap)
  - Location: src/experiment/postprocess.py:87
  - Symptoms: `use_gpu=True` is a no-op; CPU scipy path always used.
  - Impact: Slower post-processing on large batches if GPU desired.
  - Fix Plan: Implement pooling-based dilation/erosion (1D max-pool trick) and parity tests vs CPU within tolerance.
  - Owner: Post-processing

- ✅ **FIXED** - Issue: Confidence scoring method defaults and parity
  - Severity: P1 (evaluation nuance)
  - Location: src/experiment/events.py:116–139, 163–176
  - Symptoms: Defaults to `mean`; percentile/peak supported. Lack of tests tying confidence to TAES or operating points.
  - Impact: Confidence column for CSV_BI may not reflect chosen clinical criterion.
  - Fix Plan: Add tests covering mean/peak/percentile and document default in Phase 5.
  - Owner: Evaluation/Post-processing

- ✅ **FIXED** - Issue: Extras drift (scikit-image vs scipy)
  - RESOLUTION: Removed scikit-image from extras as we use scipy (already in base deps)
  - Severity: P1 (dependency/docs drift)
  - Location: pyproject optional extra `post` (scikit-image) vs code using `scipy.ndimage`
  - Symptoms: Docs advertise scikit-image; code uses scipy for morphology.
  - Impact: Confusion; unnecessary dependency or missed optimization.
  - Fix Plan: Either migrate to scikit-image ops or update extras/docs to reflect scipy-only path.
  - Owner: Docs/Infra

## P2 ISSUES - PERFORMANCE AND MINOR PROBLEMS

### EXISTING P2 ISSUES

- ✅ **FIXED** - Issue: BCE with logits reconstructed from probabilities
  - RESOLUTION: Model now outputs raw logits, sigmoid applied only at inference
  - Severity: P2 (numerical suboptimality)
  - Location: src/experiment/pipeline.py: train_epoch()
  - Symptoms: Model outputs Sigmoid probabilities; training reconstructs logits via `torch.logit(probs.clamp(...))` to use `BCEWithLogitsLoss`.
  - Impact: Extra non-linear step; may reduce numerical headroom at extremes.
  - Workaround: Keep as-is; stable with clamp.
  - Owner: Training
  - Notes: Consider changing detection head to output raw logits and apply Sigmoid only at inference.

- 📚 **ARCHIVED** - Issue: Balanced sampler label aggregation cost
  - NOTE: Acceptable for current scale. Future optimization when needed.
  - Severity: P2 (performance)
  - Location: src/experiment/pipeline.py: main(), create_balanced_sampler()
  - Symptoms: Builds `all_labels` by iterating full dataset, materializing labels for sampler.
  - Impact: Slow startup and high memory on large sets.
  - Workaround: Disable balanced sampling or compute window-level label presence offline.
  - Owner: Pipeline

### NEW P2 ISSUES (Discovered in Audit)

- ✅ **FIXED** - Issue: Config.from_yaml not implemented but used in main()
  - Severity: P2 (missing method)
  - Location: src/experiment/pipeline.py:607
  - Symptoms: `Config.from_yaml(Path(args.config))` but Config class has no from_yaml method
  - Impact: AttributeError when running CLI
  - Fix Plan: Implement from_yaml classmethod in Config
  - Code Fix:
    ```python
    @classmethod
    def from_yaml(cls, path: Path) -> "Config":
        import yaml
        with open(path) as f:
            data = yaml.safe_load(f)
        return cls(**data)
    ```

- ✅ **FIXED** - Issue: Missing Config root class that combines all sub-configs
  - Severity: P2 (missing schema)
  - Location: src/experiment/schemas.py
  - Symptoms: No Config class that combines DataConfig, ModelConfig, etc.
  - Impact: Can't validate full config structure
  - Fix Plan: Add Config class that composes all sub-configs
  - Code Fix:
    ```python
    class Config(BaseModel):
        data: DataConfig
        preprocessing: PreprocessingConfig
        model: ModelConfig
        postprocessing: PostprocessingConfig
        training: TrainingConfig
        evaluation: EvaluationConfig
        experiment: ExperimentConfig
    ```

- ✅ **FIXED** - Issue: Unused global threshold vs hysteresis definitions in docs/code
  - RESOLUTION: Removed global threshold references, using only hysteresis tau_on/tau_off
  - Severity: P2 (documentation drift)
  - Location: README.md, PHASE4_POSTPROCESSING.md vs evaluate.py
  - Impact: Confusion over intended thresholding pipeline.
  - Owner: Docs/Eval

- ✅ **FIXED** - Issue: mypy float return in events
  - Severity: P2 (type hygiene)
  - Location: src/experiment/events.py:160
  - Symptoms: Returning `np.clip(...)` inferred as Any → mypy error.
  - Fix Plan: `return float(np.clip(confidence, 0.0, 1.0))`.
  - Owner: Post-processing

- 📚 **ARCHIVED** - Issue: WSL/joblib warning noise
  - NOTE: Benign warning, does not affect functionality. Can set JOBLIB_TEMP_FOLDER if needed.
  - Severity: P2 (cosmetic)
  - Location: pytest warnings (joblib serial mode)
  - Symptoms: Permission denied → serial mode warning.
  - Fix Plan: Optionally set `JOBLIB_TEMP_FOLDER` in CI; otherwise ignore as benign.
  - Owner: CI/Infra

# CRITICAL FIX PRIORITIES

## Must Fix Before ANY Training/Evaluation (P0 Blockers):
1. EEGWindowDataset type inconsistency - blocks all training
2. Config schema mismatches - blocks config loading
3. Missing Config.from_yaml - blocks CLI usage
4. Missing TrainingConfig.batch_size - blocks training
5. Missing output_dir in ExperimentConfig - blocks checkpoint saving
6. Window stitching for correct FA/24h - blocks accurate evaluation
7. Threshold search semantics (use τ_on/τ_off, not unused global threshold)

## Fix Plan Execution Order:
1. **Phase 1: Type Safety** (Fix dataset return types, ensure consistent tuple returns)
2. **Phase 2: Schema Alignment** (Add missing Config class, align yaml with schemas)
3. **Phase 3: Window Stitching** (Implement proper stitching for overlapped windows)
4. **Phase 4: Threshold Logic** (Switch to τ_on search; derive τ_off)

---

## Phase 4 Decisions (Robust Path, No Surprises)

### Thresholding Semantics (Chosen Approach)
- Decision: Eliminate separate global thresholding in evaluation. Search over hysteresis τ_on only; derive τ_off = max(0, τ_on − Δ).
- Default Δ: 0.08 (consistent with 0.86/0.78). Expose as `hysteresis.delta` for tuning.
- Implementation:
  - Change `find_threshold_for_fa_eventized` to binary-search τ_on in [τ_off_min+Δ, 1.0].
  - Remove `threshold` arg from `batch_probs_to_events` or keep for backward-compat but unused.
  - Ensure `postprocess_predictions` only uses hysteresis; no hidden sample-level gating.
  - Update tests to assert FA rate changes monotonically with τ_on.

### FA/24h Time Accounting
- Decision: Compute total_hours per-record after stitching (or from known durations), not from flattened sample counts.
- Implementation:
  - Use `stitch_windows` for probabilities/masks as needed.
  - Track per-record lengths (seconds) from dataset metadata; sum to total_hours.

### Morphology GPU
- Decision: Implement 1D pooling-based dilation/erosion for GPU parity (optional), with tolerance tests vs CPU scipy.

### Confidence Scoring
- Decision: Keep default `mean` confidence; add tests for `peak` and `percentile` and document implications in Phase 5.

---

## Test Gaps To Add (Once Code Changes Land)
- Hysteresis τ_on/τ_off search changes FA rate monotonically (binary search convergence checks).
- Equal-threshold semantics: probs==τ_on/τ_off do not flip state.
- Stitching correctness: overlap_add and weighted variants; boundary windows.
- GPU morphology parity: pooling-based approach within tolerance to scipy.
- Event confidence: mean/peak/percentile in [0,1], consistent sorting.
- GPU-only Mamba tests: dispatch on CUDA, kernel coercion (conv 5→4) and env override.

---

## Ownership & Coordination
- Pipeline/Data: dataset tuple contract; balanced sampler expectations.
- Schemas/Packaging: strict nested PostprocessingConfig; entrypoint fix; config migration.
- Evaluation/Post-processing: τ_on search; stitching-based time accounting; morphology GPU parity; confidence tests.
- CI/Infra: WSL/joblib warning mitigation; optional `SEIZURE_MAMBA_FORCE_FALLBACK=1` for CPU-only CI.

# Coordination Notes
- Phase 4 implementation (postprocess/events/export) will address stitching, morphology, and eventization; evaluation should be refactored to consume those APIs.
- Mamba CUDA/CPU dispatch appears robust; no P0 found after gating and kernel-width coercion.

## 🏁 MISSION ACCOMPLISHED 🏁

All P0/P1/P2 bugs have been addressed. The codebase is:

# Historical Code Snippets for Critical Fixes (Already Applied)

## Fix 1: EEGWindowDataset Type Consistency
```python
# In src/experiment/data.py:349-357
def __getitem__(self, idx: int) -> tuple[torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor]:
    window = torch.from_numpy(self._windows[idx])
    if self.transform is not None:
        window = self.transform(window)

    if self._labels:
        label = torch.from_numpy(self._labels[idx])
    else:
        # ALWAYS return tuple with zero labels when none exist
        label = torch.zeros(window.shape[-1], dtype=torch.float32)

    return window, label  # ALWAYS return tuple
```

## Fix 2: Add Missing Config Class
```python
# In src/experiment/schemas.py
class Config(BaseModel):
    """Root configuration combining all sub-configs."""
    data: DataConfig = Field(default_factory=DataConfig)
    preprocessing: PreprocessingConfig = Field(default_factory=PreprocessingConfig)
    model: ModelConfig = Field(default_factory=ModelConfig)
    postprocessing: PostprocessingConfig = Field(default_factory=PostprocessingConfig)
    training: TrainingConfig = Field(default_factory=TrainingConfig)
    evaluation: EvaluationConfig = Field(default_factory=EvaluationConfig)
    experiment: ExperimentConfig = Field(default_factory=ExperimentConfig)

    @classmethod
    def from_yaml(cls, path: Path) -> "Config":
        import yaml
        with open(path) as f:
            data = yaml.safe_load(f)
        return cls(**data)
```

## Fix 3: Add batch_size to Proper Location
```python
# Move batch_size from yaml data: section to training: section
# OR add to DataConfig schema as it relates to data loading
class DataConfig(BaseModel):
    batch_size: int = Field(default=32, ge=1, le=512, description="Batch size for training")
```

# Triage Owners
- Pipeline/Data: unlabeled dataset handling; sampler assumptions
- Packaging/CLI: evaluate entrypoint mismatch
- Evaluation/Post-processing: FA/24h time accounting; stitching; eventization semantics
- Training: logits vs probabilities
