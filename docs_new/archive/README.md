Archive (Historical Docs)

This directory indexes archived documentation kept for historical context.

Phase docs (archived in-place for now)
- Location: docs_new/phases/*. These files are bannered as [ARCHIVED] and point to the
  canonical, code-aligned replacements under docs_new/components/.
- Rationale: avoid breaking links during the migration. We will physically move them to
  docs_new/archive/phases/ in a subsequent pass once downstream links are updated.

Canonical replacements
- See docs_new/components/ (Data I/O, Caching & Sampling, Models, Training, Postâ€‘processing,
  Evaluation, Configs) for the authoritative documentation.
