## v3.0.1 - CRITICAL Patient Leakage Fix (2025-09-24)

### 🚨 EMERGENCY RELEASE - ALL PREVIOUS MODELS INVALID

**Type**: Critical Bug Fix
**Severity**: P0 BLOCKER

### WARNING: IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

If you have ANY models trained before this release, they are **scientifically invalid** due to patient-level data leakage between training and validation splits.

### What Happened

During a critical code review, we discovered that patient `aaaaagxr` (and potentially hundreds of others) appeared in BOTH training and validation splits with different recording sessions. This means:

1. **All validation metrics were artificially inflated**
2. **Models learned patient-specific patterns rather than generalizable seizure patterns**
3. **Any published results using these models are invalid**

### The Fix

#### Patient-Level Disjoint Splits (P0 BLOCKER FIXED)
- **Before**: File-level alphabetical splitting that mixed patients across splits
- **After**: Using TUSZ official train/dev/eval splits with enforced patient disjointness
- **Verification**: Runtime checks that fail immediately if any patient appears in multiple splits

```python
# New validation at startup
✅ PATIENT DISJOINTNESS VERIFIED - No leakage!
Train: 579 patients, 4667 files
Val: 53 patients, 1832 files
```

#### FA Curve Threshold Bug (P0 BLOCKER FIXED)
- **Before**: `sensitivity_at_fa_rates()` passed ignored threshold parameter
- **After**: Properly clones post_cfg and sets tau_on/off for each FA target
- **Impact**: FA curve values were inconsistent with actual thresholds used

### Additional Fixes
- **TensorBoard Import**: Now optional with try/except pattern
- **TCN Config**: Removed unused `channels` field
- **Manifest Handling**: NPZ files without labels now excluded
- **CLI Robustness**: Threshold export handles string/numeric key variations

### Required Migration Steps

1. **Delete Contaminated Cache**:
   ```bash
   rm -rf cache/tusz/train_windows/ cache/tusz/dev_windows/  # Note: Now using 'dev' to match TUSZ naming!
   rm -rf /results/cache/tusz/  # Modal
   ```

2. **Update Configuration**:
   ```yaml
   data:
     data_dir: data_ext4/tusz/edf  # Parent directory
     split_policy: official_tusz    # REQUIRED
   ```

3. **Rebuild Cache & Restart Training**:
   ```bash
   python -m src train configs/local/train.yaml  # Will rebuild cache
   ```

### Impact Assessment
- **Research**: Any results must be re-run with proper splits
- **Production**: Models in production are unreliable
- **Publications**: Consider retracting or updating any published results

### Technical Details
- New module: `src/brain_brr/data/tusz_splits.py` for official split handling
- Runtime validation prevents any patient overlap
- All configs updated to use `split_policy: official_tusz`

**Tag**: `v3.0.1-critical-patient-leakage-fix`

## v2.3.0 - TCN Architecture + Training Robustness (2025-09-23)

### 🚀 Major Architecture Change
**Replaced U-Net + ResCNN with Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN)**

Complete architectural refactor with TCN for superior temporal modeling + massive training stability improvements.

### ✨ Key Highlights

#### Architecture Revolution
- **NEW**: TCN encoder (8 layers, dilated convolutions)
- **KEPT**: Bidirectional Mamba-2 (6 layers, O(N) complexity)
- **RESULT**: ~34M parameters, faster training, better gradients

#### Training Robustness 🛡️
- **NaN Protection**: Comprehensive handling with isolation and diagnostics
- **Focal Loss Fix**: Numerical stability (clamped logits, bounded p_t)
- **Gradient Monitoring**: Enhanced tracking and intelligent clipping
- **Recovery**: Can now continue training through intermittent NaN losses

#### Critical Fixes 🔧
- **NaN Accumulator**: Fixed bug where one NaN contaminated all future losses
- **Focal Underflow**: Prevented (1-p_t)^gamma → 0 with high confidence
- **Performance Tests**: Hardware-aware thresholds (RTX: 125ms, A100: 110ms)
- **Mixed Precision**: Better FP16 stability with optional sanitization

### 🔧 Configuration

```yaml
model:
  architecture: tcn  # TCN + Mamba hybrid

  tcn:
    num_layers: 8
    channels: [64, 128, 256, 512]
    kernel_size: 7
    dropout: 0.15
    stride_down: 16
    use_cuda_optimizations: true

  mamba:
    n_layers: 6
    d_model: 512
    d_state: 16
    conv_kernel: 4  # CUDA constraint
    # v2.6 preview: Dynamic GNN + LPE will use learned adjacency from an edge Mamba stream (no heuristic cosine/correlation graphs). PyG SSGConv (alpha=0.05) + Laplacian PE (k=16) is the canonical backend.
```

### 📊 Training Progress
- Local: Loss converging healthily (~2.5-3.0)
- Modal A100: 100-epoch training in progress
- Expected: ~100 hours, ~$319 total cost

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes
- Model checkpoints from v2.2.x incompatible
- Config requires `tcn:` section (not `unet:`/`rescnn:`)

## v0.2.0 - Critical Bug Fixes (2025-09-21)

### 🚨 Critical Fixes Required

This release fixes **P0 blockers** that prevented seizure detection in training. If you're using v0.1.0, **upgrade immediately**.

### What's Fixed

#### CSV Parser (CRITICAL)

- **After**: Parser correctly reads all seizure annotations
- **Impact**: Training now finds 313 partial and 55 full seizure windows in test cache

#### Seizure Type Detection
- **Before**: Only looked for "seiz" label (doesn't exist in TUSZ)
- **After**: Detects all TUSZ types: gnsz, fnsz, cpsz, absz, spsz, tcsz, tnsz, mysz
- **Impact**: Complete seizure coverage in training data

#### Training Stability
- Implemented BalancedSeizureDataset with SeizureTransformer's formula
- Added hard guards to prevent training with 0 seizures
- Fixed Modal pipeline limiting to 50 files instead of 3734

#### Configuration Cleanup
- Reorganized configs into clean `local/` and `modal/` structure
- Fixed WSL2 compatibility issues
- Verified A100 optimizations for cloud training

### Quick Upgrade

```bash
git pull
git checkout v0.2.0

# For local training
python -m src train configs/local/train.yaml

# For Modal cloud
modal run --detach deploy/modal/app.py::train
```

### Verification

After cache build, you should see:
```
✅ Cache build complete + manifest: partial=XXX, full=XX, none=XXXX
```

If `partial > 0`, the fixes are working correctly.
