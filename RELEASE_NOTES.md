# Release Notes

## v3.0.1 - CRITICAL Patient Leakage Fix (2025-09-24)

### üö® EMERGENCY RELEASE - ALL PREVIOUS MODELS INVALID

**Type**: Critical Bug Fix
**Severity**: P0 BLOCKER

**WARNING: ALL PREVIOUS TRAINING RESULTS ARE INVALID**

This emergency release fixes a **CRITICAL BUG** where patients appeared in both training and validation splits, completely invalidating all previous validation metrics.

### What Happened

During a critical code review, we discovered that patient `aaaaagxr` (and potentially hundreds of others) appeared in BOTH training and validation splits with different recording sessions. This means:

1. **All validation metrics were artificially inflated**
2. **Models learned patient-specific patterns rather than generalizable seizure patterns**
3. **Any published results using these models are invalid**

### Critical Fixes

- **PATIENT LEAKAGE ELIMINATED** (P0 Blocker):
  - Previous file-level alphabetical splitting mixed patient data across train/val splits
  - Now using TUSZ official train/dev/eval splits with enforced patient disjointness
  - Runtime validation fails fast if any patient appears in multiple splits
  - Files: `src/brain_brr/data/tusz_splits.py` (new), `src/brain_brr/train/loop.py`

- **FA Curve Threshold Bug** (P0 Blocker):
  - `sensitivity_at_fa_rates()` was passing ignored threshold parameter
  - Now properly clones post_cfg and sets tau_on/off for each FA target
  - File: `src/brain_brr/eval/metrics.py`

### Also Fixed
- **TensorBoard Import**: Now optional with try/except pattern
- **TCN Channels Config**: Removed unused field that was ignored by implementation
- **Manifest Strictness**: NPZ files without labels now excluded with warnings
- **CLI Threshold Export**: Robust key coercion for "10", 10, or 10.0

### Verification
```
[SPLIT STATS] OFFICIAL TUSZ SPLITS:
  Train: 579 patients, 4667 files
  Val:   53 patients, 1832 files
  ‚úÖ PATIENT DISJOINTNESS VERIFIED - No leakage!
```

### Required Migration Steps

1. **Stop All Training Immediately**
   ```bash
   tmux kill-session -t train
   modal app stop <app-id>
   ```

2. **Delete Contaminated Cache**
   ```bash
   rm -rf cache/tusz/train_windows/
   rm -rf cache/tusz/val_windows/
   rm -rf /results/cache/tusz/  # Modal
   ```

3. **Update Configuration**
   ```yaml
   data:
     data_dir: data_ext4/tusz/edf  # Parent directory
     split_policy: official_tusz    # REQUIRED
   ```

4. **Rebuild Cache with Proper Splits**
   ```bash
   python -m src build-cache \
     --data-dir data_ext4/tusz/edf \
     --cache-dir cache/tusz
   ```

5. **Restart Training from Scratch**
   ```bash
   # Local
   make train-local

   # Modal
   modal run --detach deploy/modal/app.py \
     --action train --config configs/modal/train.yaml
   ```

### Impact Assessment

- **Research**: Any results must be re-run with proper splits
- **Production**: Models in production are unreliable and must be replaced
- **Publications**: Consider retracting or updating any published results

### Lessons Learned

1. **ALWAYS use patient-level splits for medical data**
2. **NEVER split by files when files belong to patients**
3. **ALWAYS validate disjointness before training**
4. **Official splits exist for a reason - use them!**

- **Performance Tests**: Hardware-aware thresholds (RTX: 125ms, A100: 110ms)
- **Mixed Precision**: Better FP16 stability with optional sanitization

### üîß Configuration

```yaml
model:
  architecture: tcn  # TCN + Mamba hybrid

  tcn:
    num_layers: 8
    channels: [64, 128, 256, 512]
    kernel_size: 7
    dropout: 0.15
    stride_down: 16
    use_cuda_optimizations: true

  mamba:
    n_layers: 6
    d_model: 512
    d_state: 16
    conv_kernel: 4  # CUDA constraint
    # v2.6 preview: Dynamic GNN + LPE will use learned adjacency from an edge Mamba stream (no heuristic cosine/correlation graphs). PyG SSGConv (alpha=0.05) + Laplacian PE (k=16) is the canonical backend.
```

### üìä Training Progress
- Local: Loss converging healthily (~2.5-3.0)
- Modal A100: 100-epoch training in progress
- Expected: ~100 hours, ~$319 total cost

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes
- Model checkpoints from v2.2.x incompatible
- Config requires `tcn:` section (not `unet:`/`rescnn:`)

## v0.2.0 - Critical Bug Fixes (2025-09-21)

### üö® Critical Fixes Required

This release fixes **P0 blockers** that prevented seizure detection in training. If you're using v0.1.0, **upgrade immediately**.

### What's Fixed

#### CSV Parser (CRITICAL)
- **Before**: Training detected 0% seizures due to broken TUSZ CSV_BI parser
- **After**: Parser correctly reads all seizure annotations
- **Impact**: Training now finds 313 partial and 55 full seizure windows in test cache

#### Seizure Type Detection
- **Before**: Only looked for "seiz" label (doesn't exist in TUSZ)
- **After**: Detects all TUSZ types: gnsz, fnsz, cpsz, absz, spsz, tcsz, tnsz, mysz
- **Impact**: Complete seizure coverage in training data

#### Training Stability
- Implemented BalancedSeizureDataset with SeizureTransformer's formula
- Added hard guards to prevent training with 0 seizures
- Fixed Modal pipeline limiting to 50 files instead of 3734

#### Configuration Cleanup
- Reorganized configs into clean `local/` and `modal/` structure
- Fixed WSL2 compatibility issues
- Verified A100 optimizations for cloud training

### Quick Upgrade

```bash
git pull
git checkout v0.2.0

# For local training
python -m src train configs/local/train.yaml

# For Modal cloud
modal run --detach deploy/modal/app.py::train
```

### Verification

After cache build, you should see:
```
‚úÖ Cache build complete + manifest: partial=XXX, full=XX, none=XXXX
```

If `partial > 0`, the fixes are working correctly.
