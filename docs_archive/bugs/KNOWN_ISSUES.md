# Known Issues (Historical Index)

Note: This file is kept for historical reference. All issues listed here have been resolved. For current status, see `docs/HISTORY.md`. Active issues: none.

Note: This document captures historical issues and may reference legacy module
names (e.g., `src/experiment/*`) and configs (e.g., `configs/production.yaml`).
The current implementation lives under `src/brain_brr/*` and uses environment-
specific configs listed in `DOCS_SSOT.md`.

## P0 ISSUES - CRITICAL RUNTIME FAILURES

### EXISTING P0 ISSUES (Already Documented)

- ‚úÖ **FIXED** - Issue: Pipeline CLI requires labels but datasets created without labels
  - Severity: P0 (crash at runtime)
  - Location: src/experiment/pipeline.py: train() and train_epoch(); src/experiment/data.py: EEGWindowDataset
  - Symptoms: `train_epoch` assumes `(windows, labels)` but `EEGWindowDataset` returns only `windows` when `label_files=None` (as used in pipeline.main). Also, `create_balanced_sampler` builds `all_labels` via `train_dataset[i][1]`, which fails when labels are absent.
  - Repro:
    - `python -m src.experiment.pipeline --config configs/production.yaml` (with no label files provisioned)
  - Impact: Training CLI unusable on unlabeled data; sampler creation crashes; first-batch label extraction crashes.
  - Workaround: Provide label files and adapt dataset instantiation; or disable balanced sampling and avoid sampler path (not recommended for production).
  - Owner: Pipeline/Data
  - Notes: Decide contract for `EEGWindowDataset`: always return `(window, label)` and synthesize zeros when labels absent, or adjust pipeline to support unlabeled runs.

- ‚úÖ **FIXED** - Issue: Evaluation entry point in pyproject points to non-existent function
  - Severity: P0 (packaging/CLI break)
  - Location: pyproject.toml: [project.scripts] `evaluate = "src.experiment.evaluate:main"`; but `src/experiment/evaluate.py` has no `main`.
  - Symptoms: Installed script `evaluate` fails to run/import.
  - Repro: `uv run evaluate` (after install)
  - Impact: Broken CLI for evaluation when installed as a package.
  - Workaround: Use `python -m src.cli evaluate ...` instead.
  - Owner: Packaging/CLI
  - Notes: Either add `main()` in evaluate.py or point script to `src.cli:main` with a subcommand.
