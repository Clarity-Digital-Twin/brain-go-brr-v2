# ARCHITECTURE CLARIFICATION: What We're Actually Building

## THE CONFUSION (let's kill it)

**Q: Are we using SeizureTransformer's pretrained weights?**
**A: NO. We CANNOT.**

**Q: Why not?**
**A: We're CHANGING the architecture.**

## What SeizureTransformer Has

```
SeizureTransformer = U-Net + ResCNN + Transformer + Pretrained Weights
                                       ^^^^^^^^^^^
                                       We're replacing this
```

## What We're Building

```
Our Model = U-Net + ResCNN + Bi-Mamba-2 + Train from Scratch
                              ^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                              Different!   Required!
```

## The Hard Truth

### ❌ CANNOT DO:
- Use SeizureTransformer's pretrained weights (architecture mismatch)
- Load their checkpoint directly (Transformer ≠ Bi-Mamba-2)
- Transfer learning from their model (incompatible layers)

### ✅ MUST DO:
- **Train from scratch** on TUH/CHB-MIT data
- Implement our own preprocessing (MNE hybrid or pure scipy)
- Build the entire pipeline ourselves

### ✅ CAN DO:
- Copy their U-Net encoder/decoder architecture (same structure)
- Copy their ResCNN bottleneck design (same structure)
- Use their hyperparameters as starting points

## Two Possible Paths (CHOOSE ONE)

### Path A: Pure SeizureTransformer (No Changes)
```python
# Just use their model as-is
model = SeizureTransformer()
model.load_state_dict(torch.load('their_weights.pth'))
# Done. Ship it. But it's NOT our innovation.
```
**Pros:** Works today, proven performance
**Cons:** No Mamba benefits, O(N²) complexity, can't handle 24-hour EEGs

### Path B: Our Custom Architecture (RECOMMENDED)
```python
# Build U-Net + ResCNN + Bi-Mamba-2
model = OurSeizureDetector()  # Custom implementation
# Train from scratch
train_model(model, tuh_dataset)
```
**Pros:** O(N) complexity, handles long recordings, our innovation
**Cons:** Need to train (2-3 days on A100), need data

---

## FINAL ANSWER

### We are doing Path B:
1. **Architecture:** U-Net (copy ST) + ResCNN (copy ST) + Bi-Mamba-2 (NEW)
2. **Weights:** Train from scratch (REQUIRED - architecture changed)
3. **Preprocessing:** MNE for EDF I/O, scipy for DSP (our choice)
4. **Timeline:** 2-3 days training on TUH dataset

### Why Path B?
- **Mamba's O(N) beats Transformer's O(N²)** for long EEGs
- We can process 24-hour recordings (Transformer can't)
- It's actual innovation, not just copying

### What this means for preprocessing:
Since we're training from scratch anyway, we can use **whatever preprocessing we want**:
- MNE hybrid (robust)
- Pure scipy (simple)
- Custom pipeline (flexible)

## Action Items

1. **Stop looking for SeizureTransformer weights** - we can't use them
2. **Get TUH/CHB-MIT dataset** - we need training data
3. **Implement the architecture** - U-Net + ResCNN + Bi-Mamba-2
4. **Pick preprocessing** - I recommend MNE hybrid from PREPROCESSING_STRATEGY.md
5. **Train from scratch** - 2-3 days on good GPU

---

## One-Line Summary

**We're taking SeizureTransformer's U-Net+ResCNN design, swapping their Transformer for Bi-Mamba-2, and training from scratch because the architectures are incompatible.**
