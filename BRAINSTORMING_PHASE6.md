# BRAINSTORMING_PHASE6 ‚Äî Streaming Infrastructure Research & Implementation Strategy

**Purpose**: Consolidate all streaming research, identify the best approaches from literature, and determine which reference repos/papers to leverage for Phase 6 implementation.

## üéØ Executive Summary

After extensive research into streaming inference for EEG/medical signals, **THREE KEY INSIGHTS** emerge:

1. **Mamba already has streaming support** - The recurrent mode in `mamba_ssm` is designed for stateful inference
2. **Don't reinvent buffering** - MNE-LSL or FieldTrip patterns are battle-tested for EEG streaming
3. **Our existing code is 70% there** - We have HysteresisState, StreamingPostProcessor; just need to add duration filtering & flush

## üî¨ Research Findings

### 1. **Mamba's Built-in Streaming Capabilities** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Why this matters**: We're already using Bi-Mamba-2, and it has THREE modes:
- **Convolutional** (for parallel training) ‚Üê We use this
- **Recurrent** (for streaming inference) ‚Üê We SHOULD use this for Phase 6
- **Continuous** (for theory/analysis)

**Key implementation detail from `mamba_ssm/ops/selective_scan_interface.py`**:
```python
# Mamba maintains hidden states between chunks!
def selective_scan_fn(
    u, delta, A, B, C, D=None,
    z=None, delta_bias=None, delta_softplus=False,
    return_last_state=False,  # <-- KEY FLAG
    prev_state=None,           # <-- PASS PREVIOUS STATE
):
    """
    u: (batch, length, d_in)
    prev_state: (batch, d_in, d_state) - carry this between chunks!
    """
```

**Action**: Use Mamba's recurrent mode with state caching between chunks

### 2. **EEG-BiMamba Paper (Our Literature)** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

From `/literature/markdown/EEG-BIMAMBA/EEG-BIMAMBA.md`:
- Implements bidirectional Mamba for EEG (exactly what we're doing!)
- Handles variable-length sequences via ST-Adaptive module
- **Key insight**: They use class tokens for temporal adaptability
- Achieves "fast inference speed and efficient memory-usage in processing long EEG signals"

**Action**: Study their bidirectional implementation for streaming hints

### 3. **MNE-LSL vs FieldTrip Buffer** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**MNE-LSL** (Python-native):
- Pure Python implementation with Lab Streaming Layer
- Ring buffer with head/tail pointers
- Ships with liblsl packaged in wheels
- Direct integration with MNE (which we already use)

**FieldTrip** (C/MATLAB):
- Mature 10+ year solution
- TCP server architecture
- Multiple concurrent readers
- More complex setup but proven in production

**Verdict**: Use MNE-LSL for simplicity; keep FieldTrip as fallback

### 4. **Real-Time Performance Benchmarks (2024)** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

Recent papers show these are achievable targets:
- **56.7ms inference** per chunk (Real-time Sub-milliwatt paper, Oct 2024)
- **30MB memory footprint** for entire pipeline
- **<100ms latency** per 10s chunk is standard
- **5√ó faster than Transformers** with Mamba

### 5. **Continuous Batching Research (2024-2025)** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

Key papers:
- **"Memory-aware Dynamic Batching"** (March 2025, arXiv:2503.05248)
  - 8-28% throughput gains with dynamic batch sizing
  - Real-time memory monitoring

- **"BucketServe"** (July 2025, arXiv:2507.17120)
  - Groups by sequence length to minimize padding
  - 3.58√ó higher throughput than baseline

**Relevance**: These patterns work for variable-size chunks in streaming

### 6. **Pyannote-style Stitching** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

From speaker diarization community:
- Overlap-add for smooth boundaries
- Proven in production VAD systems
- Handles chunk boundaries elegantly
- See: https://huggingface.co/pyannote/segmentation

## üèóÔ∏è Proposed Architecture (Best of All Worlds)

### Core Components:

```python
# 1. STREAMING INGESTION (MNE-LSL pattern)
class StreamIngester:
    def __init__(self, chunk_size=2560, overlap=256):
        self.ring_buffer = RingBuffer(capacity=chunk_size * 2)
        self.overlap = overlap  # For morphology context

    def chunk_generator(self, edf_path):
        # Yield overlapping chunks
        pass

# 2. STATEFUL MAMBA (from mamba_ssm)
class StatefulBiMamba:
    def __init__(self, model):
        self.model = model
        self.forward_states = [None] * 6  # 6 layers
        self.backward_states = [None] * 6

    def process_chunk(self, x):
        # Use selective_scan_fn with prev_state
        # Return new states for next chunk
        pass

# 3. BOUNDARY-SAFE STITCHING (pyannote pattern)
class StreamStitcher:
    def __init__(self, overlap=256):
        self.overlap = overlap
        self.prev_chunk_end = None

    def stitch(self, curr_probs, prev_probs=None):
        # Overlap-add at boundaries
        # Weight by distance from edge
        pass

# 4. ENHANCED STREAMING PROCESSOR (our existing + new)
class StreamingPostProcessor:
    # Our existing code PLUS:
    - Duration filtering with event buffer
    - Flush() method for stream end
    - SeizureEvent creation with confidence
```

- **Pyannote**: https://github.com/pyannote/pyannote-audio
- **NEDC Tools**: Our existing `/reference_repos/nedc-bench`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Avoid These Pitfalls

### Don't Reinvent:
- ‚ùå Custom SSM scan implementations (use Mamba's)
- ‚ùå Ring buffer from scratch (use MNE-LSL pattern)
- ‚ùå TCP/WebSocket server (use LSL if needed)
- ‚ùå Event scoring (use NEDC tools we have)

### Don't Chase:
- ‚ùå Neuromorphic/SNN approaches (different hardware)
- ‚ùå FieldTrip C server (unless MNE-LSL fails)
- ‚ùå Complex batching (we process one stream)

## üìã Action Items

### Immediate (Before Starting Phase 6.1):
```bash
# 1. Study Mamba recurrent mode
cd reference_repos/mamba
grep -r "return_last_state" .
grep -r "prev_state" .

# 2. Check our BiMamba implementation
cd ../..
grep -r "class.*Mamba" src/

# 3. Review existing streaming.py
cat src/experiment/streaming.py | head -100
```

### To Download/Clone:
1. ‚úÖ Mamba repo (already have)
2. ‚è≥ MNE-LSL (needed)
3. ‚è≥ Pyannote-audio (for stitching reference)

### PDFs to Read:
1. ‚úÖ EEG-BIMAMBA.pdf (our literature)
2. ‚úÖ NEDC scoring docs (our target metric)
3. ‚è≥ Stateful Conformer paper
4. ‚è≥ Mamba-2 paper (for SSD insights)

## üí° Final Recommendation

**GO WITH**: Mamba recurrent mode + MNE-LSL patterns + Our existing code

**WHY**:
- We're 70% there with existing StreamingPostProcessor
- Mamba already supports stateful inference
- MNE-LSL is Python-native and integrates with our stack
- This is 2-3 days of work, not 5

**SKIP**:
- External auditor's SzCORE suggestion (we use NEDC)
- FieldTrip buffer (too complex for our needs)
- Neuromorphic approaches (different paradigm)

---

**Bottom Line**: We enhance our existing streaming.py with Mamba's recurrent mode and MNE-LSL buffer patterns. No wheel reinvention, just smart integration of proven components.

Ready to pull the trigger on Phase 6.1? Just say the word and I'll start implementing StatefulBiMamba!
