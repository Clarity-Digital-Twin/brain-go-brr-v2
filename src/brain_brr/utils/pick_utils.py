    """Subset and impose exact channel order robustly across MNE versions and test doubles.

    This utility ensures channels are selected AND ordered exactly as specified,
    working around MNE API differences and test mock limitations.

    Key insight: When you pass INTEGER INDICES to raw.pick(), MNE preserves
    the order you provide. This bypasses the need for the 'ordered' parameter
    entirely.

    Args:
        raw: MNE Raw object or test mock with channel data
        required: List of channel names in the EXACT order needed

    Returns:
        (raw_modified, missing): Modified raw object and list of missing channels
        The raw object is modified in-place and also returned.

    Implementation strategy:
    1. Compute integer indices for the required channels
    2. Use raw.pick() with those indices (preserves order)
    3. Call reorder_channels() as a safety net if available
    4. Fall back to pick_channels() for older MNE versions
    5. Last resort: build a new RawArray for test mocks
