"""Brain-Go-Brr: TCN + Bi-Mamba-2 for TUSZ seizure detection.

V3 dual-stream architecture combining:
- TCN (Temporal Convolutional Network) for efficient feature extraction
- Bidirectional Mamba-2 for O(N) sequence modeling with state-space models
- GNN (Graph Neural Network) with dynamic Laplacian positional encoding
- Multi-head gated fusion for node/edge stream combination

v3.6.0: Modal training baseline with constants centralization
- All clinical thresholds centralized in constants.py with WHY documentation
- Modal A100-80GB smoke test validated
- Production-ready configuration for long training runs
- Enhanced documentation and code organization
"""

__version__ = "3.6.0"

# NO HEAVY IMPORTS AT PACKAGE LEVEL
# Models should be imported explicitly when needed:
#   from src.brain_brr.models.detector import SeizureDetector
# This avoids importing torch/mamba when just accessing utilities
