Legacy Documentation Archive (pre‑v2.3)

This folder holds documentation for components and wiring that are no longer part of the
active runtime stack (now TCN → Bi‑Mamba → GNN + LPE → Projection/Detection).

Moved here:
- unet.md — U‑Net encoder/decoder
- rescnn.md — Residual CNN bottleneck
- decoder.md — U‑Net decoder (upsampling path)
- full-model.md — Full U‑Net path wiring

These pages are preserved for historical context and ablations. They are not referenced by
the main docs index anymore.
