# TUSZ Header Fix Integration Summary

## What We Learned
From the TUSZ_EDF_HEADER_FIX.md document, we learned that 1 out of 865 files in TUSZ v2.0.3 eval dataset has a malformed EDF header with incorrect date separators (colons instead of periods at byte offset 168-175).

## Our Solution
Since we're using **MNE (not pyedflib)**, MNE is already more permissive and likely handles this file. However, we added a robust fallback for edge cases:

### Implementation in src/experiment/data.py
1. **Primary Attempt**: Try loading with MNE (already permissive)
2. **Fallback**: If MNE fails with header/startdate error:
   - Create temporary copy of file
   - Fix date separators (colons → periods) at byte 168-175
   - Retry loading with MNE
   - Delete temporary file

### Key Advantages
- **Non-destructive**: Works on temp copy, preserves original
- **Minimal overhead**: Only triggers on actual header errors
- **MNE-based**: Leverages MNE's existing permissiveness
- **100% coverage**: Ensures no valid seizure data is skipped

### Test Coverage
Added `test_load_edf_header_repair_fallback` to verify the repair mechanism works correctly when encountering malformed headers.

## Impact on Phases

### Phase 1 (Data Pipeline) ✅
- Added header repair fallback to `load_edf_file()`
- Updated documentation in PHASE1_DATA_PIPELINE.md
- Added test coverage for repair mechanism
- All tests passing

### Phase 2 (Model) ✅
- No impact - operates on preprocessed windows

### Phase 3 (Training) ✅
- No changes needed - benefits from Phase 1 robustness
- Will achieve 100% file coverage on TUSZ dataset

## Clinical Relevance
- **Real-world data often has issues**: Hospital EDF files frequently have formatting quirks
- **Can't skip seizure data**: Every file might contain critical seizure events
- **Robustness matters**: Production systems must handle edge cases gracefully

## Status
✅ **Complete** - Header repair integrated and tested in Phase 1 data pipeline
