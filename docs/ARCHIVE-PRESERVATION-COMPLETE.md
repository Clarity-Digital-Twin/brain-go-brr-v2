# Archive Preservation Complete ✅

## What We Extracted and Preserved

After thorough review of 43 files in `/docs_archive/`, we've successfully preserved all valuable unique content:

### 1. ✅ **Empirical Seizure Type Frequencies**
- **From:** TUSZ_SEIZURE_TYPES_CRITICAL.md
- **Preserved in:** `01-data-pipeline/tusz-csv-parser.md`
- **Value:** Exact occurrence counts for all 8 seizure types (gnsz: 46.5%, fnsz: 37.1%, etc.)

### 2. ✅ **Cache Configuration Warnings**
- **From:** P1_CACHE_STRATEGY_OSS_BLOCKER.md
- **Preserved in:** `04-reference/configs.md`
- **Value:** Critical warning about config conflicts that waste OSS contributor time

### 3. ✅ **Architecture Decision Rationale**
- **From:** ARCHITECTURE_CLARIFICATION.md
- **Preserved in:** `02-architecture/canonical-spec.md`
- **Value:** Clear explanation why we can't use SeizureTransformer pretrained weights

### 4. ✅ **Critical Bug History**
- **From:** Multiple P0 bug files
- **Preserved in:** `01-data-pipeline/CRITICAL-ISSUES-RESOLVED.md`
- **Value:** Zero-seizure cache disaster, focal loss issues, WSL2 hangs, etc.

### 5. ✅ **SeizureTransformer Sampling Formula**
- **From:** TUSZ_SAMPLING_STRATEGY.md
- **Already in:** `01-data-pipeline/tusz-cache-sampling.md`
- **Value:** D = Dps ∪ D*fs ∪ D*ns with exact ratios (0.3× full, 2.5× background)

## What We Discarded (Redundant/Obsolete)

- 11 phase docs → replaced by components/
- 15+ duplicate bug reports → consolidated in CRITICAL-ISSUES-RESOLVED.md
- Old implementation plans → superseded by working code
- Test logs and temporary notes → no longer relevant
- Archived READMEs → redundant index files

## Archive Analysis Documents

Created three tracking documents:
1. `ARCHIVE-MIGRATION-DECISION.md` - Initial decision to review archives
2. `ARCHIVE-ANALYSIS-COMPLETE.md` - Full analysis of what to preserve
3. `ARCHIVE-PRESERVATION-COMPLETE.md` - This summary of completed work

## Final State

**Before:**
- `/docs/` - 42 files in 5 directories (clean, organized)
- `/docs_archive/` - 43 files in 6 directories (redundant, obsolete)

**After:**
- `/docs/` - 45 files with all critical content preserved
- `/docs_archive/` - Ready to DELETE

## Recommendation: DELETE /docs_archive/

We've extracted everything valuable. The archives now only create confusion. The new `/docs/` structure with selective preservation is complete and superior.

```bash
# Safe to execute:
rm -rf /home/jj/proj/brain-go-brr-v2/docs_archive
```

All institutional knowledge preserved. No critical information lost. ✅
