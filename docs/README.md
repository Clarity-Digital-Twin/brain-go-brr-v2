Brain-Go-Brr v2 Docs (Canonical)

This folder is the single source of truth for project docs going forward. It replaces scattered, historical notes with concise, developer-focused references that map 1:1 to the current codebase and CI.

- TUSZ/ — Everything to ingest, cache, sample, and train with TUSZ
- components/ — Canonical, code-aligned docs per component (replacing Phase docs)
- deployment/ — Local (WSL2/Linux) and Modal guides
- architecture/ — Canonical model and pipeline specs
- implementation/ — Preprocessing, evaluation checklist, benchmarks, setup notes
- deployment/WSL2/ — Deep dives for Windows + WSL2 specifics
- future_work/ — Plans and research directions
- archive/ — Historical docs and postmortems
 - archive/phases/ — Archived Phase docs (moved); see components/ for replacements
