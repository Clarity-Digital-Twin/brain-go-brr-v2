Post-processing (Hysteresis → Morphology → Duration)

Scope
- Convert per‑timestep probabilities to discrete seizure events.

Pipeline
- Hysteresis: tau_on=0.86, tau_off=0.78 to reduce flicker and capture continuity; stability windows min_onset≈128, min_offset≈256 samples (at 256 Hz).
- Morphology: remove spurious spikes, fill short gaps.
- Duration filter: discard events shorter than minimal clinically relevant duration.
- Event generation: convert masks to interval events for evaluation.
 - Window stitching: overlap‑add to reconstruct full‑record timelines (60s windows, 10s stride).
 - Merging: merge gaps ≤ tau_merge (e.g., 2.0s). Confidence = mean/peak/percentile within event.

Notes
- Tune thresholds on dev set; keep eval rules consistent with TAES.
