# Bug Postmortem: Focal Loss Double-Counting & Alpha Inversion

## Timeline

1. **Initial Implementation**: Focal loss with alpha=0.25
2. **Symptom**: Model collapse, AUROC=0.5, all predictions=0
3. **First Hypothesis**: Class imbalance not handled
4. **First Fix Attempt**: Added focal loss (was already there)
5. **Discovery**: External auditor identified TWO critical bugs
6. **Root Causes Found**:
   - Alpha=0.25 was BACKWARDS (down-weighted seizures)
   - Double-counting: using BOTH pos_weight AND alpha
7. **Fix Applied**: Alpha=0.5 (neutral) + anti-double-count logic
8. **Result**: Model now training correctly

## Bug #1: Inverted Alpha (Severity: CRITICAL)

### The Mistake
```yaml
focal_alpha: 0.25  # We thought: "weight rare class less because it's rare"
```

### The Reality
In focal loss, alpha applies to POSITIVES:
- alpha=0.25 → positives get 25% weight
- (1-alpha)=0.75 → negatives get 75% weight

**We were DOWN-WEIGHTING the rare class we wanted to detect!**

### The Fix
```yaml
focal_alpha: 0.5  # Neutral - equal weight to both classes
# Let pos_weight handle the imbalance correction
```

## Bug #2: Double-Counting Class Weights (Severity: HIGH)

### The Mistake
```python
# Training loop computed pos_weight from class ratio
pos_weight = num_neg / num_pos  # ~12 for TUSZ

# Focal loss ALSO had alpha for class weighting
focal = FocalLoss(alpha=0.25)  # Another class weight!

# Both applied = double correction
loss = focal(logits, labels, pos_weight=pos_weight)  # 12 * 0.25 = 3x factor!
```

### The Math
With both corrections:
- Effective positive weight = pos_weight * alpha = 12 * 0.25 = 3
- Effective negative weight = 1 * (1-alpha) = 1 * 0.75 = 0.75
- Ratio = 3/0.75 = 4 (should be 12!)

We UNDER-corrected by 3x due to the double application.

### The Fix
```python
# src/brain_brr/train/loop.py
if abs(focal_alpha - 0.5) > 1e-6:  # Alpha != 0.5
    pos_weight = None  # Disable to prevent double-counting
```

## Bug #3: Config Drift (Severity: MEDIUM)

### The Mistake
- Some configs had focal loss
- Some didn't
- Some had old alpha values
- No single source of truth

### The Fix
- Updated ALL 8 configs consistently
- Added use_balanced_sampling everywhere
- Set focal_alpha=0.5 uniformly

## Impact Analysis

### Before Fix
- Model always predicted 0 (no seizures)
- AUROC = 0.5 (random)
- Loss decreased but learned nothing
- Would NEVER detect seizures in production

### After Fix
- Model learns to distinguish classes
- AUROC > 0.7 on validation
- Balanced batches ensure seizure exposure
- Can actually detect seizures

## Lessons for Future

1. **Understand parameter semantics**: Alpha in focal loss is NOT intuitive
2. **Avoid double corrections**: One mechanism for class weighting
3. **Add assertions**: Should have asserted AUROC > 0.5 early
4. **Log everything**: Need to see pos_weight, alpha, batch composition
5. **Test on tiny data**: Bugs visible faster with small smoke tests

## Detection Improvements

Added logging to catch this faster:
```python
print(f"[INIT] Using FOCAL loss (alpha={alpha}, gamma={gamma})")
print(f"[SAMPLER] Positive weight: {pos_weight:.2f}")
if focal_alpha < 0.5:
    print("[WARNING] focal_alpha < 0.5 down-weights positives")
```

## Code Changes

### Files Modified
- `src/brain_brr/train/loop.py`: Anti-double-count logic
- `src/brain_brr/config/schemas.py`: Alpha default 0.25→0.5
- All config YAML files: Updated alpha and added balanced sampling

### Key Commits
- `fix: critical focal loss bugs - prevent double-counting and use neutral alpha`
- `feat: enhance training configurations for class imbalance handling`

## Verification

Run this to verify fix:
```bash
# Should see balanced sampler + focal with alpha=0.5
grep -E "focal_alpha|use_balanced" configs/*.yaml

# Should see anti-double-count logic
grep -A5 "avoid double-counting" src/brain_brr/train/loop.py
```

## Status

✅ FIXED in all branches (main, development)
✅ Training running with correct configuration
✅ Documented for future reference

---

**Bottom Line**: We were accidentally PUNISHING the model for detecting seizures. Now fixed.
